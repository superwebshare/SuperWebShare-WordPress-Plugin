        ## BEFORE POSTING YOUR ISSUE

        - Please create GitHub issues only for SuperWebShare bugs. GitHub issues ARE NOT FOR SUPPORT.

        - To avoid duplicates, please search this repository for the issue.

        - Ensure you are using the most updated versions of SuperWebShare, WordPress & your theme.

        Deactivate all of your plugins. If this solves the problem, gradually activate each plugin until you spot the problematic one.

        - Change your WordPress theme to [default WordPress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/).
